Things I've had fun learning and exploring.

> Ulam Spiral from [Patterns of the Universe](https://www.amazon.com/Patterns-Universe-Coloring-Adventure-Beauty/dp/1615193235). Starting with 1 in the center, each square in a 20x20 grid is numbered in a counter-clocwise spiral. I chose to color all primes red, remaining even numbers true blue, those divisible by 3 avocado green and so on. **Colors by me**.
