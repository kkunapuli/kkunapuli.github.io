Here's a collection of research papers or other articles I found particularly interesting. They come from all over: shares from friends, my Google feed, or the paper citation equivalent of a [Wiki rabbit hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki_rabbit_hole). More recently, I've been enjoying [the morning paper](https://blog.acolyer.org/).

> ### Title Art

> Primordial Soup from [Patterns of the Universe](https://www.amazon.com/Patterns-Universe-Coloring-Adventure-Beauty/dp/1615193235). The squiggly design was created by assigning a random value to each pixel then repeatedly blurring and sharpening the image until a pattern emerges. **Colors by me**.
