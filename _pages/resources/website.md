It seems a common first post for a new blog is a how-to on making your own blog. To all of you out there: thank you!!! It helped me immensely while starting my own website. Here's a collection of my favorite tools / documentation / information sources so far.

## Getting Started: choosing a platform and layout

There's a LOT of options out there for creating your own blog or website. You can even host it yourself. I chose to host it on GitHub with Jekyll (a popular choice). GitHub allows a personal website per account and an additional site per project.
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

As you decide how to host your site, you need to consider if you want to create your own layout, use ready-made formatting, or customize an available template. Because of its extensive documentation (and clean look) I went with Minimal Mistakes. I decided to fork the project to allow for maximal customization.

## Customizing pages
(html colors, splash pages, resizing images)

## Adding content
(markdown references)
