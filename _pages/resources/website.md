It seems a common first post for a new blog is a how-to on making your own blog. To all of you out there: thank you!!! It helped me immensely while starting my own website. Here's a collection of my favorite tools / documentation / information sources so far.

This is intended to be a 'working page' I can update with new finds.

## Getting Started: choosing a platform and layout

There's a LOT of options out there for creating your own blog or website. You can even host it yourself. I chose to host it on GitHub with Jekyll (a popular choice). GitHub allows a personal website per account and an additional site per project.
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

As you decide how to host your site, you need to consider if you want to create your own layout, use ready-made formatting, or customize an available template. Because of its extensive documentation (and clean look) I went with Minimal Mistakes. I decided to fork the project to allow for maximal customization.

## Customizing Pages

Changing colors and choosing pictures was a lot of fun for me. You can be very precise by specifying colors in html color codes. I found a great website that will even suggest color collections for building a theme.
- [HTML Color Codes](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/)

My first few splash pages were scans of my own artwork. When I started, I had designs hanging on my wall ready to go. Obviously creating something new every time I wanted to create a new page isn't sustainable. Luckily there's plenty of fun, interesting, and free photographs avilalable. So far I've been enjoying Unsplash.

When I started, I didn't think about the size of my images until my site took _forever_ to load. Turns out, there's a recommended number of pixels to keep pages loading fast without losing resolution. I usually shoot for 1200 pixels wide and 500-600 pixels wide for my splash (header) photos. I even found a website that gives me plenty of control over rotation, cropping, and pixel count.

## Adding Content

Markdown is a stream-lined syntax compared to HTML; you can also add HTML tags to your Markdown if you like. It's also supported by a variety of other editors like Reddit, and JIRA.
