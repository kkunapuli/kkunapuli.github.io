Things I've had fun learning and exploring.

> Ulam Spiral from [Patterns of the Universe](https://www.amazon.com/Patterns-Universe-Coloring-Adventure-Beauty/dp/1615193235). Starting with 1 in the center, each square in a 20x20 grid is numbered in a counter-clockwise spiral. I chose to color all primes red, then even numbers true blue, ones divisible by 3 avocado green, and so on. **Colors by me**.

## Big Data

[Store ALL the Data]({% link _pages/dfs/distributed_system.md %})
: I had a great time designing and building a Distributed File System (DFS) with a team and wanted to share some of the things I learned.

[Split it. Map it. Send it. Count it!]({% link _pages/dfs/distributed_system.md %})
:  With a team, I explored concurrency and synchonization by creating a MapReduce application. It's a simple use case - count the number of occurrences of unique words - but requires muilti-threading, locks, and a barrier to get it right.

MapReduce: bloom filter
: in progress
