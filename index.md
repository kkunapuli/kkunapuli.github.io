I like to read, create, & learn new things; this is my space to share it all.

> Petit Fourier from [Patterns of the Universe](https://www.amazon.com/Patterns-Universe-Coloring-Adventure-Beauty/dp/1615193235). Petite Fourier is an intricate pattern created by applying a fourier transform to a ring of circles; the masterhead logo is an uncropped version of the same picture. Creating with color and pattern is one way I like to relax. All title art on this site is a result of many hours spent with my colored pencils and an inspiring design. **Colors by me**.
